# About fan content policies
_Doki Doki: The Angel Returns_ is a fan mod for Doki Doki Literature Club that combines the Doki universe and the Bendy and the Ink Machine universe together. Because we are making a wonderful story based off of two popular video games, we are complying with two fan content policies. This page outlines important information regarding this topic.

## What policies are we complying with?
There are two main policies that we are complying with:

- Team Salvato's IP Guidelines set the rules for Doki Doki Literature Club mods and assets. Without these quidelines, we wouldn't have a mod for you. [Read the guidelines &rsaquo;](http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/)
- Joey Drew Studios's/theMeatly Games's Fan Content Policy sets the rules for the Angel entering the Doki universe. Without these guidelines, The Angel wouldn't be in Monika's reality. [Read the policy &rsaquo;](https://joeydrewstudios.com/fancontentpolicy)

## What if there is a violation?
We strive to follow both policies to the best of our abilities so that we create an amazing, content-filled story. However, we do sometimes make mistakes that can violate these policies. If you see something in our mod that doesn't quite live up to the expectations, we highly urge you to do the following:

- **File a guideline violation issue on GitHub.** We will mark it as a guideline violation and work on resolving the issue immediately. [File a violation issue &rsaquo;](https://github.com/TheAngelReturns/the-angel-returns/issues/new)
- **Reach a Director or Diplomat in The Studio** Message the @Directors or @Diplomats in The Studio (our Discord server), and we will investigate the matter.
- **Send an email to us.** Send us an email at [theangelreturns@aliceos.app](mailto:theangelreturns@aliceos.app) and we'll look into the violation and fix it as soon as possible.
