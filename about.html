                <h3>Will you capture her inky heart?</h3>
                Doki Doki: The Angel Returns is an unofficial mod for the game <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i> that takes place after the events of the game and <i>Bendy and the Ink Machine</i>. This mod is the result of an experiment to bring a character from one game to another with a Character File Format converter (<code>.chr</code>) in hopes of answering the question: <i>What happens if Alice Angel enters the Dokiverse?</i>

                <h3>Solve unique puzzles</h3>
                The Angel Returns brings some new, intriguing puzzle minigames in between each day. However, these aren't standard puzzles. These puzzles challenge the brain and think outside of the box for some of the solutions. Some puzzles can include changing the game's settings or manipulating files in the player's Home directory to achieve an action.
